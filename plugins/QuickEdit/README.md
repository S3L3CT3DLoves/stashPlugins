# Configuration
Configuration happens in the Config UI, you can access it by clicking the "gear" icon in any scene (should be next to the "Organised" icon)
This will allow you to define:
- Tag groups you want to use
- Which tag belongs to which group
- Set aliases for Tags (to shorten their names for example)
- Only display groups of tags if a certain tag is selected

# Warning
The configuration is saved in the brower's LocalStorage, don't clear it or you will lose your configuration !


This plugin does not play nicely with the traditional **Edit** tab in Stash.

Because the plugin saves all the changes directly, this is not reflected in the Edit tab.

After using **QuickEdit**, reload your browser page before making changes in the **Edit** tab.
