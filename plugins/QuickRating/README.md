# *QuickRating*
Replaces the rating input in Stash to make it easier to select a scene's rating with one click

# Requirement
- Stash (v0.27+)
- Install CommunityScriptsUILibrary from the Stash Community repo

# Goal
For people who want a score with more granularity than the 5 stars in Stash.

The *half-star* rating in Stash is too fiddly and requires too many clicks to get the correct rating.

The *decimal* rating is precise, but forces you to use the keyboard + mouse.

The goal with this plugin is to give more options to the user, that can be used one-handed, and in a single click.

# Usage
After installing it in your Stash, enable one of the configuration flags in the Stash plugin page.
- Slide 10: Will display the score as a slider between 1 and 10, with a small textbox to display the number
- Slide 20: Will display the score as a slider between 1 and 20, with a small textbox to display the number

**Don't forget to reload the browser page after making a Configuration change.**

Not enabling any of the configuration flags will simply use the native rating system in Stash.

*More modes to come, I hope to add a 1-10 star score soon.*
