# *folderSort*
Organise your PMV folder using data from Stash

Designed to keep all your PMVs in folders named based on the PMV **Creator**

# Usage
The plugin is executed by pressing the button in the Task menu.

This was built pre-v24 and may not work as intended until I revisit it!

# Configuration
For now configuration is done directly in the code, I'll add it in a separate file in the future
