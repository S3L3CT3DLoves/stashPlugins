# Stash Plugins
This repo contains two plugins I built for Stash (https://github.com/stashapp/stash)

To use them, add the Github repo as a source to your Stash Plugins using the URL: https://s3l3ct3dloves.github.io/stashPlugins/stable/index.yml

## Quick Edit
This is a new UI that is displayed in the Scene view, to make it easier to Rate and Tag scenes.
> Adds a new Tab to the Scene UI to make one-handed Editing easier ðŸ˜‰

## Folder Sort
A simpler version of [renamerOnUpdate](https://github.com/stashapp/CommunityScripts/tree/main/plugins/renamerOnUpdate) for usage with PMVs.
> Designed to keep all your PMVs in folders named based on the PMV **Creator**
